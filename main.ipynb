    "# WaveNet architecture - a breif introduction\n",
    "Wavenet is an autoregressive model that use local and global embeddings to generate audio from transcripts. The local embeddings are used to convey local transcript information to the model i.e. what needs to be said and when. The global embeddings are transmitted to the entire model and can be used for e.g. speaker embeddings (generate sound in a specific voice). The model was originally praised for two things (1) producing audio that sounded very natural (2) for being parallelizable during training unilike RNNs.\n",

    "I'm not gonna explain WaveNet in details, because it would take way to much time do. I have however made a simple figure which can be seen below. This don't tell the whole story, but should hopefully get the main point(s) across. \n",
